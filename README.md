# UFX.IdentityModel.AspNetCore

**important** we have moved all active development of this library to [this](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/Duende.AccessTokenManagement) repo. You can read more about the rationale on [this](https://blog.duendesoftware.com/posts/20220804_datm/) blog post.

## Background
This library is a helper library for managing user and client access tokens in ASP.NET Core but even the new version does not yet support updating Refresh Tokens.
